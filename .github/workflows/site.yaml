### ### Drupal
###
### Checks that site can be installed and can be updated (from base branch on
### pull request).
###
### #### Assumptions
###
### 1. A docker compose service named `phpfpm` can be run and `composer` can be
###    run inside the `phpfpm` service.
### 2. The docker setup contains a database container and other the dependent
###    services and the default settings match connection credentials for these
###    services.
### 3. The Drupal site can be installed from existing config.

    # This job checks that the Drupal site can be upgraded without issues.
    #
    # We do this by
    #
    # 1. Checking out the base branch ("github.base_ref") and installing the
    #    site from scratch (using the exact same steps as the "install-site"
    #    job)
    # 2. Checking out the updated code and updating the site from the previous
    #    installation
    #
    # Notice that step 2 is NOT run with the code in our new branch, but with
    # the updated code merged on top of the target branch
    # (cf.https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/881). This makes sure that
    # we can actually update the site after merging with the base branch.
    #
    # In some cases we run into a situation where the base site (step 1) cannot
    # be installed, e.g. if this is a new project or we're making changes that
    # require manual steps on the upgrade path, and then this jobs will fail. In
    # that case we should note this in the pull request description and document
    # the steps needed to complete the upgrade path.
